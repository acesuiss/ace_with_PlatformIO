In this Modern World, we know that electricity is an essential component in our life. Millions of smart meters to check for the electricity consumption have been deployed all across the globe for many years. Further substantial and sustained growth is expected as utility companies seek more accurate, granular, and timely data to operate their businesses more efficiently. By definition, a smart meter must be connected so it can transmit data and therefore connectivity is a mission-critical requirement. With a wide range of options available, the connectivity decision is increasingly based on the cost, security, coverage, power usage, and the potential throughput of the connectivity. Each of these can cause deployments to either succeed or fail and therefore must be carefully balanced against each other to create an optimal solution.

In this project, the Aim is to Implement a system that is capable of Analyzing each device of a home or commercial building with live feedback, and bill generation . Entire process is based on the running time by each device and The Total power consumed and The monthly bill will be calculated and
Displayed on through the web dashboard or a mobile application. This system will create a great impact in the places where electricity bills play a vital role. By knowing the consumption history and by analysis a huge amount of electricity can be saved.
